# How to Create 3D Photos with 3DMasterKit 7.1
 
3DMasterKit is a software that allows you to create lenticular pictures with realistic 3D and motion effects, such as flip, animation, morphing and zoom. You can use it to create 3D photos from two or more original photos, or from one photo and a template. You can also create 3D photos for different viewing devices, such as stereoscope, anaglyph glasses, LCD shutter glasses or lenticular lens.

In this article, we will show you how to create a 3D photo with 3DMasterKit 7.1 using two original photos. You will need to download and install the software from [here](https://3dmasterkit.soft32.com/). You can use the demo version for free, but it will add a logo on the output image. To remove the logo, you will need to purchase a license from [here](https://triaxes.com/3dmasterkit/).
 
## Step 1: Load the original photos
 
Launch 3DMasterKit and select "Create a new project" from the start screen. Choose "Stereo pair" as the source type and click "Next". Browse and select the two original photos that you want to use for creating the 3D photo. They should have the same size and resolution, and they should be taken from slightly different angles to create a stereo effect. Click "Next" to load the photos.
 
## Step 2: Align the photos
 
The next step is to align the photos so that they match each other in terms of perspective and position. You can use the automatic alignment feature or manually adjust the alignment using the tools on the toolbar. You can also crop, rotate or resize the photos if needed. Click "Next" when you are satisfied with the alignment.
 
## Step 3: Set the depth range
 
The depth range determines how much depth you want to create in the 3D photo. You can use the slider to adjust the depth range from low to high. A low depth range will create a subtle 3D effect, while a high depth range will create a more pronounced 3D effect. You can also use the preview window to see how the 3D photo will look like with different depth ranges. Click "Next" when you have chosen your desired depth range.
 
## Step 4: Choose the output type
 
The final step is to choose the output type for your 3D photo. You can choose from different types of output, such as cards with stereo pairs, anaglyph images, stereo pairs for direct view, 3D images for LCD shutter glasses or lenticular images. Depending on your choice, you may need to specify some additional parameters, such as size, resolution, pitch or interlacing method. Click "Next" to generate your output image.
 
## Step 5: Save or print your 3D photo
 
You can now save or print your 3D photo using the options on the toolbar. You can also export your project as a PSD file for further editing in Photoshop or other image editors. Enjoy your 3D photo!

## Conclusion
